# File Organizer (CLI)

A Python script that automatically sorts files into categorized folders based on their extensions.

## Features
- Moves files by extension into organized folders  
- Supports Images, Videos, Documents, Audio, Archives, and Code Files  
- Creates destination folders automatically if not present  

## How It Works
1. Enter the file extension you want to sort (e.g. `.jpg`, `.pdf`)  
2. Provide source and destination folder paths  
3. The script moves matching files into the right subfolder  

## Concepts Covered
- `os` and `shutil` modules  
- File path handling  
- Automation with loops and conditionals
