# üêç Python Mini Projects

A collection of small Python projects built to strengthen core programming logic, problem-solving skills, and hands-on experience with Python fundamentals.

Each project focuses on clean code, basic error free implementation and readability.

I merged all these mini projects to give them better structure and avoid cluttering the repositories with mini projects.
